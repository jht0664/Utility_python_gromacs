LJ Polymer blend FF (fixed bond distance and no repulsion)

**********************************************
* symetric binary polymer blend system (fixed bond distance)
* ; still it does not match with the paper, because of different potential.
* On the Scaling of the Critical Solution Temperature of Binary Polymer
* Blends with Chain Length
* Fernando A. Escobedo†,‡ and Juan J. de Pablo*,†
* Macromolecules 1999, 32, 900-910
**********************************************
* I did not apply infinite repulsion within a distance less than 0.96.
* For this distance range, LJ potential is applied:
*  some A-B interaction or A-A intermolecular interaction (d < 0.96) occurs.
